The goal of this project is to design a traffic light control system. The system simply 
contains two traffic lights. One allows cars to move from north to south, and the other 
one allows cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is also a pedestrian 
traffic light. The pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the 
street safely.
